<h1>Design Module</h1>
<p>
The Design Module allows you to create a design that conforms to the rules of the selected grammar, yet is also constrained to the parts within 
the selected library.  Designs can be saved for later revision, saved as a new design, output as a sequence, or exported to GenBank format.</p>
<p>In order to create a design:</p>
<p>1. Select a grammar from the Grammar dropdown list.</p>
<p>2. Select a library from the Library dropdown list.</p>
<p>3. Build your design framework by clicking on the rules that apply to the design you are building.  For example, starting from the S (start) rule, you might choose to click on the "cas" rule to build a Cassette; 
you might then choose the "tcp+" rule to create a Promoter-Cistron-Terminator architecture; under CIS (cistron), you might choose the "rbgn+" rule to convert the CIS to RBS and GEN (gene).</p> 
<p>4. When you have established your design architecture, click on the parts you want to use within the framework defined in Step 3 above.
<p>Once a part has been selected for every terminal category in the design architecture, the user may download the sequence, either as a straight text file by clicking the <B>Download</B> button, or in GenBank format by clicking the <B>GenBank</B> button.</p>
<p> In addition to building a design for download, there are additional options available from the Design screen:</p>
<p><B>Save: </B> The Save button will allow you to save your design for later review or further development. You may also save an existing design under a new name (ie, making a copy) by selecting the <B>Save as New</B> button from the <B>Save</B> screen.  This feature is only available to logged-in users.</p>
<p><B>New Design: </B>The New Design button allows you to leave this design and start a new one.  If you have any unsaved changes to the loaded design, they will be lost if you proceed with the new design.</p>
<p><B>Load Design: </B>The Load Design button will route you to the <B>Available Designs</B> page so you can load a previously saved design, either your own or one of the public designs we provide as a sample.</p>
<p><B>History: </B> The history, which is displayed on the left side of your design, records the steps you took as you built your design.  If you want to see the process you went through to get to your current design, you can click on the <B>Step</B> buttons beneath the <B>History</B> header.  You may also use the step history to go back and make revisions, but once a revision is made, subsequent steps in the history are cleared because you are effectively rewriting history.</p>
