<h1>Simulate Design</h1>
<p>
GenoCAD uses the <a href="http://www.copasi.org/" target="_top">COPASI</a> simulation engine to allow users to view simulations of designs associated with attribute grammars.
</p>

<p>To run a simulation:</p>
<p>1. Enter the length of time (in seconds) for the full simulation in the <B>Duration</B> text box.</p>
<p>2. Enter the interval time (in seconds) between measurements in the <B>Interval Time</B> text box.</p>
<p>3. At this point, the <B># of Intervals</B> will be calculated automatically, and the <B>Run Simulation</B> button will be activated.  
Due to time constraints, GenoCAD does not currently support simulations of more than 1000 Intervals.</p>
<p>4. Click on the <B>Run Simulation</B> button.</p>

<p>This will load a graph charting the simulation of your design.  Some additional features to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>> By default, all of the data elements are charted on the graph.  If you want to remove data elements from the graph, you can click on the <B>Show Data Series</B> dropdown and uncheck 
data elements you do not want to see on the graph (or, conversely, check data elements you want to add back to the graph.)</li><li></li>
<li>> If you want to download the output of the simulation (the numbers used generate the graph) to load into another application, you can click on the <B>Download Results</B> button.</li><li></li>
<li>> If you want to zoom into a particular area of the graph, use the mouse to "draw" a box around the area you want to zoom into (in much the same way you select a box from an image using a Paint program.)  When you are ready to zoom back out to the full graph again, just double-click on the graph.</li><li></li>
<li>> If you want to view the exact coordinates of a particular spot on the graph, hover the mouse arrow over the area you are interested in, and the coordinates will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
