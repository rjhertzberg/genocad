<h1>Manage Grammar</h1>
<p>
The Manage Grammar page allows users to add, modify, and delete grammars, including their underlying categories and rules.
Users can also copy and export grammars, and delete grammars that are no longer needed. 
</p>
<p>
The following functions can be performed with either Public or User Grammars:
</p>
<p>
<B>Load another grammar:</B> This can be performed by selecting a different grammar from the dropdown list next to
the <B>Manage Grammars</B> title.
</p>
<p>
<B>Add/Import Grammar: </B> This would allow a user to add a new grammar or import an exported grammar file.
</p>
<p>
<B>Export: </B>This would allow the user to export a grammar for importing into their own workspace or to share with another user.
</p>
<p>
<B>Copy:</B> If the user is logged in, they can copy an existing grammar into their own workspace.  This would allow them
to use a public grammar as a starting point for their own grammar, or to make a backup of one of their own grammars.
</p>
<p>
<B>Test: </B> The test function allows the user to parse through the grammar much as they would in the Design module to verify that 
the grammar is organized correctly.
</p>
<p>
<B>Categories: </B> Users can select categories to view their characteristics and the rules they are associated with by clicking on the 
categories in the tree on the left.
</p>
<p>
The following functions can only be performed on User Grammars (the grammars belonging to the logged in user):
</p>
<p>
<B>Edit: </B> This button allows the user to change the name, description, starting category, and the iconset for the grammar.
</p>
<p>
<B>Delete: </B> If a grammar has not been used for the development of a library or design, it may be deleted.
</p>
<p>
<B>New Category: </B> This allows the user to add a new category.  This would include a short version of the category name (ie, PRO for promoter),
a longer, more descriptive category name, the GenBank identifier, and the icon from the grammar's iconset that should be associated with the category.
</p>
<p>
<B>Edit Category: </B> If the user has selected a grammar from the tree on the left, then they can click on this button to edit the name, GenBank identifier, or icon.
</p>
<p>
<B>Delete Category: </B> A category may only be deleted if it is not used in a rule, and if it hasn't been assigned to a part.
</p>
<p>
<B>Add Rule: </B> This would allow the user to add a new rule to their grammar.  Clicking this button would load the Add Rule page, where the 
user can use a drag-and-drop interface to create rules out of categories.  Only one category may be indicated as the Transfer From category, but as many
categories as need be may be included in the Transfer To box.
</p>
<p>
<B>Edit Rule: </B> A rule may be edited by clicking on the Edit icon to the right of the target rule.
</p>
<p>
<B>Delete Rule:</B> A rule may be deleted by clicking on the "X" icon to the right of the target rule.
