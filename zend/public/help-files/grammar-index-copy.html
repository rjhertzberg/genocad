<h1>Copy Grammar</h1>
<p>
The <B>Copy Grammar</B> page allows the user to make a copy of a selected grammar.  The <B>Name</B>, <B>Description</B>, <B>Starting Category</B>, and <B>Icon Set</B> 
are all required fields, and, with the exception of <B>Name</B>, default to the corresponding value in the original grammar (<B>Name</B> defaults to "Copy of" and the name of the Grammar). </p>
<p>By default, any library associated with the base grammar that the user has access to -- ie, public libraries or libraries defined by the logged-in user -- are also copied with the grammar, including 
associated parts and designs.  However, the user may uncheck libraries that he/she would prefer not to copy.</p>
<p>After the user clicks on the <B>Create New Grammar</B> button, they will be routed to the Grammar Editor with the new grammar loaded by default.</p>
