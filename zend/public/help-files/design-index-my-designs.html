<h1>Available Designs</h1>
<p>
The Available Designs page allows you to view and load designs, either Public designs that were created as samples for new users, or Designs that you created in the Designs module.  It should be noted that personal designs (<B>My Designs</B>) are separated from <B>Public Designs</B> and different functionality is available for each section.<p>

<p>Available features include:</p>
<p><B>Start New Design: </B>The Start New Design button will take you to the Design module to start a new design.</p>
<p><B>Export to FASTA: </B>To export a set of your designs to FASTA format, select the designs to export using the checkboxes to the left of the design names, then click on the <B>FASTA</B> button above the section where the designs appear.  It should be noted that there are separate <B>FASTA</B> buttons for the <B>My Designs</B> and <B>Public Designs</B> sections.</p>
<p><B>Export to Tab-delimited: </B>To export a set of your designs to a tab-delimited format, select the designs to export using the checkboxes to the left of the design names, then click on the <B>Tab-delimited</B> button.  The format for this export is Name, Description, Sequence.  It should be noted that there are separate <B>Tab-delimited</B> buttons for the <B>My Designs</B> and <B>Public Designs</B> sections.</p>
<p><B>Status: </B>You can view the status of your design in the column to the right of the date the design was last modified (the Status Key appears at the bottom of the list of designs.)  Design statuses can change either by a nightly job that revalidates all designs, if the design has been changed, or if one of the underlying parts has changed.
If the status suggests that the design needs to be revalidated, or if you want to revalidate the design to play it safe, click on the status icon next to the design you want to check.  This will update the status icon.</p>
<p><B>Clone a Design: </B>If you want to make a copy of a design without going into the Design module and performing a "Save as New" function, you can click on the Clone icon to the right of the design you wish to copy. Note that this functionality is only available to logged-in users.</p>
<p><B>View (or Load) a Design: </B>If you want to view one of your existing designs, click on the View icon to the right of the desired design.</p>
<p><B>Delete Selected: </B>In order to delete existing designs that you don't need anymore, select the designs to delete using the checkboxes to the left of the design names, then click on the Delete Selected button on the top of the page. Note that you can only delete your own designs, and it is not possible to delete Public Designs.</p>
