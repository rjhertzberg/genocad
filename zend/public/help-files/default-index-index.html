<h1>Home Page</h1>
<h2>Welcome to GenoCAD</h2>
<p>
GenoCAD is an application built by the Synthetic Biology Group at Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI) that allows users to develop quality-controlled 
sequences based on user-defined libraries of genomic Parts and following rules defined by design strategies called grammars.  The home page should be considered
a roadmap that guides users through the process of designing sequences.
</p>
<h2>Designing Sequences</h2>
<p>The design of sequences requires three steps, as delineated on the home page.</p>
<p><B>1. Models.</B> Click on the Models section to develop grammars and build libraries of parts for use in designing your sequences.</p>
<p><B>2. Design.</B> From the Design section, you can select from grammars and libraries to design actual genetic sequences.</p>
<p><B>3. Simulate.</B> Once your sequences are designed, you can run them through a simulator (implemented using the Copasi application) to simulate your sequence as a quality control step before sending it for synthesis.</p>

<h2>Other Options Available from the Home Page</h2>
<p><B>Sign Up:</B> (Only available if you are not logged in.)  The sign up option allows you to create your own GenoCAD account.  This step is necessary if you want to be able to save your own grammars, parts, libraries, and designs.</p>
<p><B>My Profile:</B> (Only available if you are logged in.) Clicking on this link will allow you to edit your personal settings and change your password.
<p><B>Log In:</B> If you already have a GenoCAD account, you can click on this link to log into your account and access your own grammars, parts, libraries, and designs.</p>
<p><B>My Parts:</B> Clicking this icon will allow you to jump to the <B>My Parts</B> tab of the Models Management module.  This will allow you to edit parts you entered into the system.</p>
<p><B>My Libraries:</B> Clicking this icon will allow you to jump to the <B>Libraries</B> tab of the Models Management module, with the default setting that only your libraries are displayed.</p>
<p><B>My Designs:</B> Clicking this icon will allow you to view a listing of the DNA sequences you have created, along with their statuses.</p>
<p><B>Search:</B> Clicking the magnifying glass will allow you to search for a specific part or set of parts in the database depending on a variety of criteria.</p>
<p><B>Help:</B> Clicking the question mark icon on any page will allow you to view context-sensitive help for that page.</p>
<p><B>VBI:</B> The VBI icon is a link to the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute website.</p>
<p><B><i>Follow us on</i> links:</B>  GenoCAD has a presence on many of the popular social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter, GoogleGroups, and LinkedIn.  If you follow GenoCAD on one of these sites, you can be kept in tune with new releases and other relevant information.</p>
