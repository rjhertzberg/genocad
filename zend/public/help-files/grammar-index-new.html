<h1>Add/Import Grammar</h1>
<p>
The Add/Import Grammar page allows users to either create their own grammar from scratch or import an export grammar file.  The page is divided into two sections, and the user fills in the side associated with the action he wants to take.
</p>

<p>To create a brand-new grammar:</p>
<p>1. On the left side of the page, enter the name, description, and select an iconset for the grammar you want to create.  If you are unsure which iconset you wish to use, select the name of iconset and click on the <B>Preview</B> button to see images from that set.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <B>Create New Grammar</B> button.  This will save your new grammar and load the Manage Grammar page so you can continue to refine your new grammar.

<p>To import a grammar, you will need an export file from another grammar.  With this file in hand (or on disk):</p>
<p>1. On the right side of the page, click on the <B>Browse</B> button to select the export file from your disk.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <B>Import Grammar</B> button.  This will lead to the Import Grammar page, where you will be asked to confirm some of the settings.</p>
