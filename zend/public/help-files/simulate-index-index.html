<h1>Simulate</h1>
<p>
The Simulate tab allows users to take advantage of some of the additional functionality available to designs associated with attribute grammars, such as <B>Export to SBML</B>, <B>Export equations</B>, or running a simulation of your design using <a href="http://www.copasi.org/" target="_top">COPASI</a>.
If your design was not built with an attribute grammar, you will not see it on this page, but there are Public Designs available so you can see how it works. 
</p>

<p>Available features include:</p>
<p><B>Status: </B>You can view the status of your design in the column to the right of the design description (the Status Key appears at the bottom of the page.)  Design statuses can change either by a nightly job that revalidates all designs, if the design has been changed, or if one of the underlying parts has changed.
If the status suggests that the design needs to be revalidated, or if you want to revalidate the design to play it safe, click on the status icon next to the design you want to check.  This will update the status icon.</p>
<p><B>View (or Load) a Design: </B>If you want to view one of your existing designs, click on the View icon to the right of the desired design.</p>
<p><B>Download: </B>You can download the SBML for your design.</p>
<p><B>Simulate: </B>Click on the Simulation icon to run a simulation of the associated design.</p>
