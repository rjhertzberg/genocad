<h1>Import Grammar</h1>
<p>
The Import Grammar page allows users to view the settings from the exported grammar file they are attempting to import and, if applicable, to choose to create a new iconset for the icons included with the grammar or to reuse the icons from the specified iconset.  
After confirming that this is indeed the grammar the user wishes to import and choosing whether they want to use the existing iconset or import the grammar's icons as a new iconset, the 
user can either click <B>Continue Import</B> to finish the import, or they can click on <B>Cancel Import</B> to cancel the import and return to the Model Management page.
