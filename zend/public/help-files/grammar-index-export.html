<h1>Export Grammar</h1>
<p>
The <B>Export Grammar</B> page allows the user to export a selected grammar in order to save a backup or to share it with another GenoCAD user.  Unlike the <B>Copy Grammar</B> feature, the <B>Name</B>, <B>Description</B>, <B>Starting Category</B>, and <B>Icon Set</B> cannot be edited when exporting a grammar -- these values default to the corresponding values in the exported grammar</p>
<p>By default, any library associated with the base grammar that the user has access to -- ie, public libraries or libraries owned by the logged-in user -- are also exported with the grammar, including 
associated parts and designs.  However, the user may uncheck libraries that he/she would prefer not to copy.</p>
<p>After the user clicks on the <B>Export</B> button, they are not rerouted to the Grammar Editor.  In order to return to the grammar editor, the user must click on the <b>Back to Grammar Editor</b> button.</p>
